# Basic-Geometric-Calculator
Java project repository designed to facilitate geometric calculations for various shapes, including squares, triangles, and circles. The repository contains classes that implement methods for computing properties such as circumference, surface area, and volume for each shape.

The main class, "Driver," serves as the entry point for the program, it has a user-friendly interface through Java Swing's JOptionPane for selecting a shape and initiating calculations.

The repository includes individual classes for each geometric shape: Square, Triangle, and Circle. Each shape class contains methods to input necessary parameters, perform calculations, and display the results using JOptionPane dialogs.

Additionally, the project has an abstract class, "Shapes," to define a common interface for shape calculation methods, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
